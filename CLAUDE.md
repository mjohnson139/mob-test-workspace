## Project Rules

This branch follows the Agent Mob QRSPI workflow defined in `AGENTS.md`.

- **Phase artifacts are append-only** — never delete or overwrite another participant's file
- **R phase:** Read only `Q/questions.md` — do not read `Q/task.md` or other R files
- **D phase:** Lead only. The designer must ask clarifying questions before writing `design.md`
- **Commit format:** `[mob] {action}: {description}`
- **main branch:** Never merge project work to main

See `AGENTS.md` in the root of the mob repo for the full rulebook.
